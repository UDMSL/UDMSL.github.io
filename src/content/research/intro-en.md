We investigate ultrafast molecular dynamics in chemical, biological, and nanoscale materials ranging from femtoseconds to nanoseconds. As these dynamics are crucial for the function of semiconductors, biomolecules, and nanomaterials, elucidating their mechanisms is essential for optimizing material efficiency.

We utilize advanced time-resolved techniques including transient absorption, 2D electronic spectroscopy, X-ray solution scattering, and cw/pulsed-EPR. These methods capture real-time snapshots of excited states and structural changes. Our key research interests cover solar cells, quantum dots, photosynthetic systems, and carbon nanotubes, focusing on exciton evolution, charge transfer, and energy relaxation.
